Built with the experience of more than 10 years VirtueMart 3 provides you with a powerful and comprehensive eCommerce solution. We give you a flavour of the work we have done to provide you with one of the best open-source e-commerce solution around!</p>
<p>This new generation of the ecommerce platform VirtueMart includes many new features under the hood and is a continuous development of VM2. Our main focus was to make it compatible with Joomla 3, cleaning the architecture, increasing the stability, and increasing the performance. In short: looking superficially at VirtueMart 3 it looks and works almost as VM2, but the feeling and handling is different.</p>
<p>Thousands of man hours have been spent and countless changes have been done updating and enhancing VirtueMart. We are happy and thank the many dedicated developers and store owners that helped to test and provide positive feedback on this most recent version.</p>
<p>VM2 to VM3 is an upgrade, implemented using the Joomla install manager - it does not require a migration (as was the case for VM1 to VM2). We have maintained as much compatibility as possible with VM2 but we have had to make some changes in order to deliver the improvements in VM3.</p>

</div>
<h3>Your Shoppers and Store Owners benefits</h3>
<p>Shoppers will be delighted by the enhanced speed, add to cart buttons in the category browse view, and simpler checkout. Shop owners will notice the enhanced backend speed and simplified customfields. Shop builders will find a lot more tools to fulfill the wishes of their customers.</p>
<p>The ajaxified reload of product variants and neighboured products enhance the browsing experience significantly. To ensure proper loading of JavaScript we had to implement our own Javascript loader. We may extend this feature also to other views for example the pagination of the product browse page.</p>
<p>New internal program caches reduce the sql queries for the most used tasks by more than 25%. Heavy functions are additional cached with the Joomla cache.</p>
<h3>Developers benefits</h3>
<p>The new core has an advanced cart with enhancements to provide better update compatibility. For example the new custom userfields include now an option to be displayed on the checkout page and can use their own overridable mini layouts, making it easy to adjust the cart to legal requirements without touching the template. The data stored in the session is minified, which can be easily modified by plugins (for example to adjust the weight). The cart is automatically stored for registered users. The cart checks also for any reload of the available quantity of the items and corrects it if needed.</p>
<p>You can re-use your layouts by using the new sublayouts (like minilayouts). They give your store a consistent appearance and make it easier to adjust standards for different layouts in one overridable file. The input data is very unified which makes it stable against updates. This is very handy for the native "add to cart" button and customfields in the category browse view. New parameters in the Joomla menu settings for virtuemart views and modules provide more flexibility and better joomla integration.</p>
<p>Frontend managing combined with the Joomla ACL now allows your vendors to directly access the VirtueMart backend from the frontend, without having access to the Joomla backend. The system now provides different modes for different multivendor systems. VM3 is now prepared to work with a sales team, or shipment team.</p>
<p>We reduced the dependencies on Joomla, but increased on the other hand the integration. For example, the core now uses only the JFormFields of Joomla 2.5 and not any longer the old vmParameter, but we added vRequest (MIT) as choice for JInput. Developers can now use the normal JFormField joomla conventions for all plugins.</p>
<h3>Customfields refined</h3>
<p>With new options, redesigned and a lot more flexible to use. In VM2 you had to override none or all customfields of the parent. In VirtueMart 3 you can disable or override each customfield independent of the others. This makes creation of product variants a lot easier and faster. The new child variants gives the possibility to display products with up to 5 rambifications (can be increased), which depend on each other. Very important is also the new behaviour that you can use one customtype as often you want for one product.</p>
<p>"Additional Shoppergroup" is a new feature for shoppergroups, which does not replace the default groups. This is very handy if you use the default shoppergroups for calculation.</p>
<h3>jQuery clearance</h3>
<p>The new jQuery versions are now mainly the same as in Joomla 3.3 (jQuery v1.11.0,jQuery UI - v1.9.2, legacy complete). Shops using Joomla 2.5 with VirtueMart 3 also benefit from this. It prevents needless configuration problems.</p>
<h3>Extensions ready for VM3</h3>
<p>All changes in the API have been deeply tested and most 3rd party developers have updated their extensions already. The whole core and extensions are now working with the new abstraction layer (vmText, vRequest,...). Please visit <a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net">http://extensions.virtuemart.net</a> for updates of your extensions.</p>

<p>If you cannot update VirtueMart, please follow those <a href="http://virtuemart.net/#fix">instructions</a>.</p>
<h3>Our Security policy</h3>
<p>There were recently some misconceptions about our security policy. Some people complain that we are not following the "Full Disclosure" philosophy (please read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_(computer_security)">Full disclosure (computer security)</a>&nbsp;). The "Full Disclosure" comes from the beginning of the open source movement and is also to see as an answer to the "non-disclosure" behavior of proprietary software vendors. The experience was that sent vulnerabilities were not fixed. So the people learnt that revealing the vulnerability in public lead to a fast reaction of the blamed company. The evil guys of this business just started to blackmail companies. <br />There are of course also some other advantages. In case of Linux kernels, the idea is that all together work on a fix for it. The leaks are often a lot complexer and so the more people know about the faster it is fixed. Furthermore anyone should be able to learn from the leak to prevent the issue in future.</p>
<p>In our case, the most security leaks are fixed within minutes, maybe within 1-2 hours. So the argument, the more people the faster a fix is ready is not suitable for joomla/extensions. So we are following the philosophy of the "responsible disclosure" (please read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">Responsible disclosure</a>&nbsp;). Also <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/responsible-disclosure-sucuri-open-letter-to-mailpoet-and-future-disclosures.html">sucuri.net</a> is following this idea. They are professionals and know how to handle a vulnerability for the best of all users. They informed us secretly about the problem. We fixed it within a day, they tested our fix and asked if it is the right time to inform their customers. We did the most important thing, to provide a fix, only missing was the "responsible disclosure". So I agreed, but misunderstood them, because I did not meant that they disclosure the vulnerability in detail. A correct disclosure in our environment (php, opensource) must also always contain an explanation to fix the issue manually. The other reason is that the problem is actually in the joomla user "model" , and it should be also fixed in the JUser to prevent misuse of it before we should do the "Full disclosure". Persuading the joomla developers to protect their model got complexer than thought. Their argument is that there is no problem as long as you are using the Joomla Form. We got just stuck and must now prepare an explanation, why it is always bad to allow any form to override internal variables of an object.</p>
<h3><a name="fix"></a>How to get the security fix without updating VirtueMart</h3>
<p>If you cannot update VirtueMart, there are two possibilites:</p>
<h4>Exchange the file models/user.php</h4>
<p>The easiest way is just to exchange the user model with the new one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dowload the latest version (<a href="http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/784/com_virtuemart.2.6.10.zip">VirtueMart 2.6.10</a> or <a href="http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/791/com_virtuemart.2.9.9b.zip">VirtueMart 2.9.9b</a>)</li>
<li>Replace the file&nbsp;<span>/administrator/components/com_virtuemart/models/user.php</span> with the new one.</li>
</ol>
<p>The user model is almost untouched for a year, so you should first try just to exchange the model.</p>
<h4>Patch the user.php file</h4>
<p>If you think your user model is too heavily modified, it is enough to add a unset($data['isRoot']); to the top of the user store function:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<span>/administrator/components/com_virtuemart/models/user.php</span></li>
<li>Search for the function named<span> function&nbsp;store(&amp;$data,$checkToken = TRUE)</span></li>
<li>Replace <span>if (!$user-&gt;bind($data)) { </span>with
<pre>if(!$user-&gt;authorise('core.admin','com_virtuemart')){
	$whiteDataToBind = array();
	$whiteDataToBind['name'] = $data['name'];
	$whiteDataToBind['username'] = $data['username'];
	$whiteDataToBind['email'] = $data['email'];
	if(isset($data['password'])) $whiteDataToBind['password'] = $data['password'];
	if(isset($data['password2'])) $whiteDataToBind['password2'] = $data['password2'];
	} else {
		$whiteDataToBind = $data;
	}
// Bind Joomla userdata
if (!$user-&gt;bind($whiteDataToBind)) {
		.....
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We just creating a new array and setting any variable manually (white list).</p>
<h3>The real problem behind all this</h3>
<p>The JUser model bind function just loops through the properties of the class and sets data with the same name to the object. The filtering is done by an attached JForm (Gui elements) to filter the input of the data. So if developers use the joomla model without form, they have to filter the data themself, else it is possible to override internal variables of the object. <br />The binding for normal JTables does not override internal variables as long you follow the habit/convention to name them with a trailing underscore _. The check function additionally ensures that the data is correct. But the juser object does not follow the own joomla habits. Additionally it is very unclean to use MVC and to have a model, which needs GUI elements to do correct filtering. There exists enough tasks to use a model without any GUI. For a developer just using the joomla API it is like a trap. A model should be secure by itself, without the need of a "View" or "Controller" to be safe. SCNR, but joomla 2.5.16 fixed a security leak in some the JFormFields. So other solutions based on that were also very unsecure for years.</p>
<p>The suggested fix in the joomla user model is very easy. Just unset the sensitive data, if a user is not admin. This should be done in the bind function and in the store function. The advantage lays on the hand. <br />A lot other extensions for joomla become more secure. It is very unlikely that only VM has this problem.<br />People can do a small joomla update and still use their modified extensions.</p>
<p>Personally I see the request for full disclosure as a typical academic, but noobish request. Not only the good guys learn from disclosures. The black hat fraction also learns from it. It is important to differ and sometimes a full disclosure makes absolut sense, but not always. It depends on the complexity of the problem, how many people already know about, the reaction of the maintainers, and so on.</p>

<p>We finally can announce that the VirtueMart 3 core is ready as <a href="http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/759/com_virtuemart.2.9.8_extract_first.zip" target="_blank"><em>Release Candidate 2.9.8</em></a>. Now the remaining job is to test the core intensively on joomla 3.3 and to add missing backward compatibility for easy updating. As far we can see all API changes are done.</p>
<p>The primary task is now to test the plugins, adjust them to the new joomla 2.5 style and if necessary add fallbacks or provide developer information for switches in our <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/175-code-adjustments-for-virtuemart-3.html">Code adjustments for Virtuemart 3</a>. This manual will grow, the more developers provide feedback, the faster. The plugins for the customfields must be updated. All extensions working with the customs need to be updated. Except for the plugins for the customfields, the old plugins will almost directly work. The xml files must be updated to j2.5 style. They need some adjustments&nbsp;anyway to run with Joomla 3 like using vRequest (respectivly JInput).</p>
<h3>The changes in VirtueMart 3</h3>
<p>Our priority for VM3 is to develop a robust core providing a cleaner structure and less code. We reduced the dependencies on joomla, but increased on the other hand the integration. For example, the core now uses only the JFormFields of joomla 2.5 and not any longer the old vmParameter, but we added vRequest (MIT) as choice for JInput. Developers can now use the normal JFormField joomla conventions for all plugins.</p>
<p>You can re-use your layouts by using the new sublayouts (like minilayouts). They give your store a consistent appearance and make it easier to adjust standards for different layouts in one overridable file. The input data is very unified which makes it stable against updates.</p>
<p>The new core has an advanced cart with enhancements to provide better update compatibility. For example the new custom userfields now include an option to be displayed on the checkout page and can use their own overridable mini layouts making it easy to adjust the cart to legal requirements without touching the template. The data stored in the session is minified and therefore the cart now uses normal products, which can be easily modified by plugins (for example to adjust the weight).</p>
<p>The new jQuery versions are now mainly the same as in joomla 3.3 (jQuery v1.11.0,jQuery UI - v1.9.2, legacy complete). Shops using joomla 2.5 with VM3 will also benefit from this. It will prevent needless configuration problems.</p>
<p>Frontend Editing combined with the joomla ACL now allows your vendors to directly access the VirtueMart backend from the frontend, without having real access to the joomla backend. This feature is still under heavily development and we are still looking for funds to complete it. So far vendors can just create new products, edit their products and list their products. It is the first step to make multivendor accessible for normal endusers.</p>
<p>"<span title="If a user is only in a additional shoppergroup, he will become also automatically the default shoppergroup.">Additional Shoppergroup" is a new feature for shoppergroups, which do not replace the default groups.</span>
</p>
<p>New internal program caches reduce the sql queries for the most used tasks by more than 20%. &nbsp;</p>
<p>and of course the new customfields. With new options, redesigned and a lot more flexible to use.</p>
<h2>Planned</h2>
<p>A new trigger system, only for the checkout is started. It needs a new derived function/trigger and cannot be done with the old triggers. It will work with some kind of event system and call the proper plugins directly. We will write this after the first release. Old plugins then just need to be updated with the new trigger to participate in the new system.</p>
<p>Simple ajax reloading of component view. We are very happy that Max Galt, the developer of the cherry picker has donated his javascript code for dynamic reloading of products to the VirtueMart Project</p>

<h2>VirtueMart Support Membership</h2>
<p>We have successfully introduced a membership for the VirtueMart Project recently. We recognized that VirtueMart users want a safe support address if they find a bug and that a public forum is not adequate for serious business owners. In the past two years the core development team also had to spend too much time to provide customizations to make their living. Providing a really good maintained and professionally tested core takes more and more time and the complexity required to keep it simple for endusers and web agencies is increasing with every version.</p>
<ul>
	<li>VirtueMart continues with one free version</li>
	<li>Members are customers with access to our ticket system</li>
	<li>The membership helps the core developers to focus on the project and enables us to provide a very high code quality</li>
	<li>Any tier gives a vote for a desired feature to influence the roadmap</li>
	<li>Added value (multi-add layout, display shipment costs for products,...)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some nice ideas to enhance the core.&nbsp;For example multi-image upload, different sizes for images, more different layouts to choose from, angular js (very fast), more multivendor, multi-language tools, enhanced js for the BE, flexible and configurable OPC, ...</p>
<p>We also already invested into the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/advance-the-joomla-url-router">new router of Hannes Papenberg</a> and it will be provided to the VirtueMart Support Members.</p>
