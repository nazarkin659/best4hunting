VM Invoice Changelog
(C) 2011 ARTIO International Co.
--------------------------------

NOTE: Older versions of VirtueMart 2 are not guaranteed to work with VM Invoice. 
It's recommanded to use always newest version of VirtueMart, which is currently 2.0.26d and 1.1.9.

NOTE: We try to copy most precisely how VirtueMart saves order prices. 
If you encounter any bug different than default VM behavior, contact us, so we can fix.
However, VirtueMart itself can contain bugs pertaining to order prices saving. 
Thare's not much we can do about it, because we can only copy how VM orders are saved.
On the other hand, we are able to edit how prices are DISPLAYED on invoice. 
If you have any idea how to improve displaying/computing prices on invoice, contact us also.
